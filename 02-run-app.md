## Bat out of hell

Not completely without luck, you find that the previous developers have actually
    created README's for their code!

Try that and see how that flies for you.

(Of course dependencies are not explicitly managed,
so you can't just start up the application.)

Figure out the dependencies, put them in a `go.mod` file
so you can build the code.

Now that you've fixed that hurdle and you've actually got an application running,
spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with it.

### Task

- Investigate dependencies
- Put dependencies in `go.mod`
- Build with `go build`
- Run with `go run ..`
- Familiarize yourself with the application
